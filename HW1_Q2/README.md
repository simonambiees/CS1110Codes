#readme file for the inputAnalysis program
##HW1_Q2

###ALL the characters on a NORMAL "QWERTY" LAPTOP KEYBOARD are supported(a.k.a. those that can be typed by any person who has used a Windows or MacOS or ChromeOS (not sure about Linux) laptop before)

####What's working:
    getting the input of the user
    getting multiple lines of input
    analysing the frequency that each character appears in the user input
    printing our the result in a formatted way
    
###How to:
    after being prompted, type whatever you want that meets the requirements and then press "Enter" TWICE!! 
    results should be displayed in no time
    
#Enjoy!!!
