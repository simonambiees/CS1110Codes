#This is the readme file for HW2_Q2
##Run"RunThis.py" to execute the program
###Features checking a point's relative position to a line entered by a user
###Results are visible in file ProgramResults.txt, with time of execution
##tried to do more coding on idiot proof, but didn't have time to finish.
##When you try all the possible combination of inputs, error will happen, I just don't know which type and when.
##Program works fine without bugs with my test values
#Enjoy!
